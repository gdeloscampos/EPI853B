## Homework 1 (due Tr. 9/8/2016, submit through D2L)

For each of the tasks described below:
   - Create, using loops, a function that carry out the needed computations,
   - Check, using 100 random tests, your function against the native R function that does the same task. You can use small matrices (i.e., nrow and ncol <10 for your tests. 
 
Tasks:
   1. Matrix products (`matProd(x,y)`)
   2. Crossproduct of two matrices (`crossprod_b(x,y)`, allow for the function to have only argument x or two (x, and y).
   3. Same as (2) with tcrossprod (`tcrossprod_b(x,y)`, allow for the function to have only argument x)
	
Report your results, for each task include the function, the test you run and the results you obtained. Your report should have at most 1 page per task.
