### EPI 853b HW2. Due Tr Oct. 5 @ class 
 
 For this HW we will use the [Gout]() data set, and in particular we will focus on a model
 for serum urate as a function of the main effects of sex, age and race. For the purpose
 of the HW use dummy variables for female and white, that is take male and black as reference
 groups. We will not use the entire data set. Instead, use simply the first 500 rows.
 
 
 (1) Effect of sample size on the expected value and SE of estimates
 
 For a sample size of N=(50,100,200,500) estimate using 10000 bootstrap samples the expected
 value and standard deviations of OLS estimates. 
 
     (1.1) Report your results in a table and your code in an appendix.
     (1.2) Comment your results
     (1.3) Obtain using lm OLS estimates and SE using the whole data set (N=500). Compare
            your results with those obtained by Bootstrap for the same sample size.
            
 (2) Using bootstrap, and for the same sample sizes considered above, report histograms
 of the sampling distribution of the log(|female-male|) effect.
	2.1. Report your results in a figure and comment what you found.
	2.2. Report your code in an appendix.
